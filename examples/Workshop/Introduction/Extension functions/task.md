##Extension functions
Kotlin, similar to C# and Gosu, provides the ability to extend a class with new
functionality without having to inherit from the class or use any type of design
pattern such as Decorator. This is done via special declarations called
[extensions](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html#extension-functions).

Read about [extension functions](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html#extension-functions) and
implement extension functions `Int.r()` and `Pair.r()` and make them convert Int and Pair to `RationalNumber`.
