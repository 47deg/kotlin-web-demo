## For loop

Kotlin [for loop](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html#for-loops)
iterates through anything that provides an iterator.
Make the class DateRange implement Iterable<MyDate>, so that it could be iterated over.
You can use the function `MyDate.nextDay()` defined in [DateUtil.kt](/#/Workshop/Conventions/For%20loop/DateUtil.kt)
