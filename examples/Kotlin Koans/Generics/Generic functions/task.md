##Generic functions
Make the following code compile by implementing function `partitionTo` that splits
collection in two collections according to a predicate.

There is the function [partition()](http://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/partition.html)
in the standard library that always returns two lists (newly created).
You shall write a function that splits the collection in two given collections as arguments.

The signature of the function
[toCollection()](http://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/to-collection.html)
 from standard library may help you.
