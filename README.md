##Installation
Try Kotlin is deployed by [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/). You can setup Tomcat locally using init.xml.
If you are installing tomcat manually, you need to download [ConnectorJ](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) lib 
and copy jar file to tomcat libraries.

You need MySql database to launch Try Kotlin, schema can be found [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-web-demo/blob/new-design-beta/kotlin.web.demo.server/resources/db_schema.sql)

##Building
Try Kotlin is IDEA project. 

Try Kotlin uses Kotlin for frontend, so latest bootstrap version of Kotlin plugin
 should be installed (see "Note for contributors" at [Kotlin repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/Kotlin#pre-built-plugin)).
 
To build this project, first time you try to build you need to run update_dependencies.xml ant script,
that will download Kotlin for user projects.

##Artifacts
Web Demo consists of two war artifacts:

 - WebDemoWar - frontend server that communicates with user, forwards kotlin-related requests to backend
 - WebDemoBackend - backend server that processes requests related with Kotlin (run, highlight, etc.)

##Environment
You need to pass some environment variables to application using tomcat context.xml. Use the following templates to 
create context files: 

 - [context for frontend](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-web-demo/blob/new-design-beta/kotlin.web.demo.server/web/META-INF/context.template.xml)
 - [context for backend](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-web-demo/blob/new-design-beta/kotlin.web.demo.backend/web/META-INF/context.template.xml)

context.xml files should be placed near the associated templates.


##Run
To run Web Demo you should build both artifacts and deploy them using Tomcat.
If you have installed Tomcat locally with init.xml and using IDEA, WebDemoServer run configuration can be used.
